# HDL_bits_Practice
This repository documents my journey of solving problems on HDLBits to strengthen my understanding of Verilog and digital design.

## What’s inside:
-HDLBits solutions organized by topic (logic, mux/demux, FSMs, sequential circuits, etc.)</br>
-Notes & comments explaining key concepts and takeaways</br>
-Testbenches & waveforms for selected problems to validate correctness</br>

I’m building this as both a learning journal and a portfolio to showcase my growth in RTL design and hardware description languages.
