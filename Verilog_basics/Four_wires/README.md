# wire4
**Problem Statement: **</br>
Create a module with 3 inputs and 4 outputs that behaves like wires that makes these connections:
a -> w </br>
b -> x </br>
b -> y </br>
c -> z </br>
The diagram below illustrates how each part of the circuit corresponds to each bit of Verilog code. From outside the module, there are three input ports and four output ports.
